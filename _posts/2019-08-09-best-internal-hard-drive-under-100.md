The Seagate [Seagate BarraCuda 2TB Internal Hard Drive HDD](https://amzn.to/2yNsGE6) sells for about $50.00 and is the best internal 3.5 inch hard drive for most of us.

2TB is enough for most users unless you are a data hoarder and it costs **well under $100.00** making it an affordable option for you if you need a good sized hard drive for backups, daily storage or for an upgrade for an older PC.
