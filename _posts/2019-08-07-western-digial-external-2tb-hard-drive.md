This [Western Digital 2TB Elements Portable External Hard Drive](https://amzn.to/2MLVSUi) costs about $65.00 and is one of the best prices for a portable external hard drive in this size range. If you need a smaller drive the 1TB approximate $50.00 [check price]{https://amzn.to/2MLVSUi) is also available and the 4TB version sells for just under $100 in most cases [check price](https://amzn.to/2MLVSUi).

For most of us, unless you have a LOT of data then the 2TB capacity is enough to store and backup your files from phone, computer or other device and this is a much cheaper option than [dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) that would charge you $12.00 a month for the same amount of storage.
