According to [Toms Hardware](https://tomshardware.com) this SSD is "[clearly the SSD SATA to buy](https://amzn.to/2YKtPfm)" and with a price well under two hundred bucks for a 2TB SSD that's fast and accelerated by micron 3D NAND technology - it's hard not to see why.

One pretty nifty feature of this drive is the fact that if the power cuts out you don't lose any data  The drive is under warranty for five years too.
